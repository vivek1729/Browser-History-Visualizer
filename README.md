# Browser-History-Visualizer
A node webkit app to visualize browser history as we surf the internet from one link to another to preserve context

The visualization is done using force layout in d3.js. Currently opening of links in new tab and new window is not suppported. 

Only two types of transitions are acknowledged - one from a link another directly put in the address bar. Nodes are color coded as per host names for clarity. Still a WIP :)
